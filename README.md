Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the recognition process of text obtained from media in the form of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text form. The text in question may be presented in the form of a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo or from subtitle text superimposed on an image.
